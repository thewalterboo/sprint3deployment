# Beating the Beats of NOBITA!

This is the repository for the files for the Streamlit Deployment of DSF Cohort 11 Sprint 3 Group 2. You can view the app through this [link](https://thewalterboo-sprint3deployment-deploy-39q50s.streamlit.app.

## About

The project analyzed [Nobita's Spotify Streams Data](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5GVk1KCKa1tdHRev4bMw7V?si=d6ZtRLIvQzilSpjaYsjlNA). The goal was to help Nobita improve their chart performance and help their songs make it to the Daily Top 200.

We also developed a recommender engine to generate songs to be included in a playlist.

## Libraries

The project was done by compiling Jupyter Notebooks from the different contributors of the group. The creators utilized Pandas, Numpy, SKLearn, Visualization Libraries (MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Plotly), Spotipy (Spotify API), and Streamlit.
